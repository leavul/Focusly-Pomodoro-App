# 🍅 Focusly - Pomodoro App

A simple Pomodoro timer mobile application built with React Native and Expo. Focusly helps users stay productive by breaking work into focused sessions with short and long breaks.

## 📱 About the App

**Focusly helps users to:**
- Track focused work sessions (Pomodoro)
- Enjoy a clean, minimal, and intuitive interface

## 👀 I created this project to learn and practice:
- React Native and Expo fundamentals
- TypeScript usage in mobile apps
- State management with Redux Toolkit
- Custom components and modular UI
- Handling timers, intervals
- Building production-ready mobile apps

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- React Native
- TypeScript
- Expo
- Redux Toolkit
- react-native-size-matters (for responsive UI)
- react-native-svg for svg icons
- expo-keep-awake to prevent device sleep during sessions

## 📚 What I Learned
Through building Focusly, I gained experience with:  
- **Timers and intervals** - Managing focus and break sessions, taking into account whether the user has the application running in the background. 
- **Redux Toolkit** - Organizing state for session durations, mode, and settings  
- **Conditional UI rendering** - Showing modals and feedback based on timer status 
- **Expo plugins** - Using prevent devices slepping by use expo-keep-awake, and use custom fonts by use expo-font
- **Responsive layouts** - Ensuring UI works on multiple screen sizes by use react-native-size-matters
- **Project structure** - Modularizing components, modals, and screens for maintainability  

## 🎯 Key Features
- Automatic session transitions
- Custom modals for confirmation and timer completion  
- Prevent device from sleeping during active sessions  

## 📝 Project Overview
Focusly is designed to help users focus better using the Pomodoro technique. All UI components, modals, and timers are built from scratch to better understand React Native fundamentals. External libraries are used only for essential utilities and Expo plugins.  

## 🎬 Conclusion
Building Focusly strengthened my React Native and TypeScript skills, especially in state management, timer logic, and modular component design. The project also improved my ability to translate designs from Replit design into a working mobile app with responsive layouts.
